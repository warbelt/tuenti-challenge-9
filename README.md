# Tuenti Challenge 9 solutions 1-9
My solutions for Tuenti Challenge 9 problems 1 to 9, all in Python 3.6

I got #4 and #8 marked as wrong, but i'm sure 8 is at least correct, as I got the secret (and gross) recipe.
#4 passed testing phase and was marked wrong for the submit phase, so it's probably failing some edge case.
